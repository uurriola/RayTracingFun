# Ray Tracing Fun

As mentioned in my [OpenGL project](https://github.com/uurriola/OpenGLFun), I learned some legacy OpenGL during engineering.
Decided to learn about ray tracing, it turns out my OpenGL lessons from engineering school already focused on this topic!
Unfortunaly, I lost the code of the project I developed back then. Anyway, I'll just learn ray tracing again!

I'll render here some results to observe my progress.

Based on [tutorials on Youtube by The Cherno](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW1Fhd9u9Q&list=PLlrATfBNZ98edc5GshdBtREv5asFW3yXl&ab_channel=TheCherno).

## Progress

*Please note that the capture frequency is pretty low. The rendering itself is not that slow.*
